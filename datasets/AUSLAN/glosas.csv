A rodent (the narrator thinks it is squirrel) got out of the burrow and the boy smelt it break wind, so he got away and went OVER there.,1
After a short walk and hunt around, he sighted a wooded vast flandland at the back of the house, which described athe nearby hillside.,1
After the boy got onto the deer, it stood up and ran.,1
He put them on.,1
He walked to an area which had a big dome-shaped rock with "branches" and a small rock in front.,1
He yelled whilst the dog looked at the outlined bands of a dome-shaped honey beehive, which was hanging in the tree.,1
Immediately, they both got on the bed, lay on it and slept.,1
Next day in the morning, the boy checked to see if the frog was still in the jar.,1
The boy also had a dog. They both enjoyed looking at the frog. Good, that's settled.,1
The boy and his dog were disappointed when they realised that the frog had disappeared.,1
The boy climbed up the rocks and so did the dog. When he held on to the "branches", he was surprised to see that they were actually deer's antlers.,1
The boy looked out through the window, looking for frog and wondered where it was.,1
The boy put on his shoes, but before putting them on, he checked inside the shoes as he thought the frog, might have been inside but there was nothing there.,1
The boy said to the dog, "Follow me", and the dog followed him running.,1
The boy saw one big tree trunk with a hole which he thought the frog was in, but when he took a close look at it, an owl got out and attacked him.,1
The boy snored as the frog escaped from the jar.,1
The boy walked impatiently as the bird flapped its wings and flew at the boy who shooed it away.,1
The dog walked to the tree with the hive and the bees swarmed out.,1
The dog with a jar stuck on its head, jumped up to the windowsill and fell to the ground.,1
This is a story about a boy who was in his bedroom and he had a frog which he kept in a stoppered jar.,1
Um, the dog was still near the beehive and when it played around with the bees, the hive fell to the ground and the bees swarmed out.,1
When the boy was looking around he saw a burrow, which he thought the frog might have been in it, so he took a closer look.,1
When the jar shattered on the ground, the boy quickly got out of the window.,1
