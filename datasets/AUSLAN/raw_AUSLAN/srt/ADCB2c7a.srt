This is a story about a boy who was in his bedroom and he had a frog which he kept in a stoppered jar.

1
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,270
The boy also had a dog. They both enjoyed looking at the frog. Good, that's settled.

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,234
Immediately, they both got on the bed, lay on it and slept.

3
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,628
The boy snored as the frog escaped from the jar.

4
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:30,606
Next day in the morning, the boy checked to see if the frog was still in the jar.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,710
The boy and his dog were disappointed when they realised that the frog had disappeared.

6
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:36,744
The boy looked out through the window, looking for frog and wondered where it was.

7
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:41,448
The dog with a jar stuck on its head, jumped up to the windowsill and fell to the ground.

8
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,159
When the jar shattered on the ground, the boy quickly got out of the window.

9
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:51,445
The boy put on his shoes, but before putting them on, he checked inside the shoes as he thought the frog, might have been inside but there was nothing there.

10
00:00:51,655 --> 00:00:53,070
He put them on.

11
00:00:53,107 --> 00:00:59,726
After a short walk and hunt around, he sighted a wooded vast flandland at the back of the house, which described athe nearby hillside.

12
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:09,716
He yelled whilst the dog looked at the outlined bands of a dome-shaped honey beehive, which was hanging in the tree.

13
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,250
The dog walked to the tree with the hive and the bees swarmed out.

14
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:17,659
When the boy was looking around he saw a burrow, which he thought the frog might have been in it, so he took a closer look.

15
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:24,061
A rodent (the narrator thinks it is squirrel) got out of the burrow and the boy smelt it break wind, so he got away and went OVER there.

16
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:31,404
The boy saw one big tree trunk with a hole which he thought the frog was in, but when he took a close look at it, an owl got out and attacked him.

17
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:37,430
Um, the dog was still near the beehive and when it played around with the bees, the hive fell to the ground and the bees swarmed out.

18
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,675
The boy walked impatiently as the bird flapped its wings and flew at the boy who shooed it away.

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,360
He walked to an area which had a big dome-shaped rock with "branches" and a small rock in front.

20
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:55,727
The boy climbed up the rocks and so did the dog. When he held on to the "branches", he was surprised to see that they were actually deer's antlers.

21
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:59,297
After the boy got onto the deer, it stood up and ran.

22
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,810
The boy said to the dog, "Follow me", and the dog followed him running.
