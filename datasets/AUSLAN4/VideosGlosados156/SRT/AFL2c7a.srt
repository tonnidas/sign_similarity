00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,670
There's a little boy who catches a frog, and he puts it in a big jar.

1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,240
Him and his dog peer down at it for a little while, and then hop into bed and go to sleep.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,590
The next day when they wake up, the frog is gone!

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,830
They look everywhere in the room, turning things OVER looking inside his shoes.

4
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:15,265
The boy sees the window, and starts calling out for the frog.

5
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:18,405
But the dog wants to help, and sticks his head inside the jar.

6
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:22,445
Then, with the jar still on his head, he hops up on the window sill with the boy, only he falls out and smashes the jar.

7
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:24,295
The boy picks him up and comforts him.

8
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:28,295
Then the both of them set off into the forest, calling out and looking high and low for the frog.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,880
The boy sees a hole in the ground. He looks down it, and a beaver jumps out of it and hits him on the nose.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,120
Nearby, the dog is barking up a tree at some bees. Of course it goes wrong, the beehive falls to the ground and the bees start chasing the dog.

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,550
And the boy, he climbs up a tree and looks in a hollow. But there's an owl in there, that flies out and surprises him, so he falls out of the tree.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,740
The two of them keep going, calling everywhere for the frog.

13
00:00:45,876 --> 00:00:52,206
So . . . The owl chases the boy, and he runs up onto a large rock. He grabs these branches sticking up behind the rock and looks around.

14
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:53,666
But he gets a shock when he realises he's actually holding onto a deer!

15
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:55,816
The deer takes off running, with the boy hanging onto it's antlers and his dog trying to keep up, running along side.

16
00:00:55,926 --> 00:01:01,876
Then the deer throws the boy off his antlers and into a pond, with his dog too.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,690
Suddenly they both catch a sound. It's the noise of a frog calling that they hear!

18
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:11,858
They sneak OVER to this big log, and look OVER it . . . There's the frog! Well, a mother and a father frog with nine little children.

19
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:13,466
Cute little things.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,698
And. . . the mother frog, well one of the frogs, I don't know whether the boy caught the mother or the father frog, one of the frogs gives the boy one of the baby frogs. The frogs say goodbye, and the boy heads home carrying a new baby frog.
