A boy has two pets, one is a frog that lived in a tall jar and the other one is a dog, like a sausage dog.,1
As they walked, they saw a burrow and the boy took a closer look at it.,1
He asked himself, where was the frog, whilst continuing to unfold his clothes.,1
He pushed at the log and saw a loving couple of frogs, sitting romantically next to each other and embracing.,1
He took one of the baby frogs whose parents embraced, indicating they wanted to stay.,1
He was shocked, looked for and started to unfold his clothes.,1
Immediately he lay on the deer, he fell into water. The dog also did this.,1
Next day in the morning, the boy woke up and was surprised to see that the frog had disappeared.,1
Suddenly, the boy tightened his grip on "the branches" and realised "the branches" were deer antlers.,1
The baby frog's father let him go with the boy and he carried it as he walked home.,1
The boy and the dog started searching for the frog, walked in the woods and yelled, "Where is the frog?" several times.,1
The boy got into bed and pulled the blankets up, while his dog slept on his bed.,1
The boy heard something, peeped and had a look around a log.,1
The boy held on to something like some branches as the dog came back again.,1
The boy leaned foward and was dazzled to see baby frogs sitting in a line.,1
The boy looked through the window and rested his hands on the windowsill.,1
The boy rubbed his nose and walked away from the burrow.,1
The boy sprinted away as the owl flew and chased him. He climbed up, landed and sat down.,1
The boy was grumpy but he patted the dog.,1
The deer ran as he lay on its head.,1
The dog and the boy looked at the frog. The dog was excited about the frog, it was an excitable dog.,1
The dog barked and after the boy checked it out, climbed up the tree. An owl attacked him by surprise, passing his head.,1
The dog looked and barked at bees as they swarmed near their dome-shaped hive.,1
The dog ran next to the deer and barked, as the deer concentrated on walking quickly.,1
The dog sitting on the windowsill, moved its head from side to side, crouched and fell to the ground, smashing and scattering glass.,1
The dog was aware of the fact that the bees had became irritated, so it ran away from them, as they swarmed.,1
The dog went searching, put its head in the jar, straightened it and turned its head from side to side.,1
The frog quieted down, got out of the jar and was soon gone.,1
When he climbed up a big rock, his dog had disappeared.,1
When it continued to bark, a rodent from the burrow bit the boy's nose.,1
When the deer stood at the lip of a short-steep drop and threw the boy, he fell down.,1
