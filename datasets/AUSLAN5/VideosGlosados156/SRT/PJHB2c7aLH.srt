A boy has two pets, one is a frog that lived in a tall jar and the other one is a dog, like a sausage dog.

1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:13,230
The dog and the boy looked at the frog. The dog was excited about the frog, it was an excitable dog.

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,440
The boy got into bed and pulled the blankets up, while his dog slept on his bed.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,900
The frog quieted down, got out of the jar and was soon gone.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,130
Next day in the morning, the boy woke up and was surprised to see that the frog had disappeared.

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,290
He was shocked, looked for and started to unfold his clothes.

6
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,140
He asked himself, where was the frog, whilst continuing to unfold his clothes.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,710
The dog went searching, put its head in the jar, straightened it and turned its head from side to side.

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,570
The boy looked through the window and rested his hands on the windowsill.

9
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:46,590
The dog sitting on the windowsill, moved its head from side to side, crouched and fell to the ground, smashing and scattering glass.

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,780
The boy was grumpy but he patted the dog.

11
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:58,120
The boy and the dog started searching for the frog, walked in the woods and yelled, "Where is the frog?" several times.

12
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,600
As they walked, they saw a burrow and the boy took a closer look at it.

13
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:08,060
The dog looked and barked at bees as they swarmed near their dome-shaped hive.

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,480
When it continued to bark, a rodent from the burrow bit the boy's nose.

15
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,410
The boy rubbed his nose and walked away from the burrow.

16
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,740
The dog barked and after the boy checked it out, climbed up the tree. An owl attacked him by surprise, passing his head.

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,530
The dog was aware of the fact that the bees had became irritated, so it ran away from them, as they swarmed.

18
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,450
The boy sprinted away as the owl flew and chased him. He climbed up, landed and sat down.

19
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,330
When he climbed up a big rock, his dog had disappeared.

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,860
The boy held on to something like some branches as the dog came back again.

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,260
Suddenly, the boy tightened his grip on "the branches" and realised "the branches" were deer antlers.

22
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,580
The deer ran as he lay on its head.

23
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,340
The dog ran next to the deer and barked, as the deer concentrated on walking quickly.

24
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:00,750
When the deer stood at the lip of a short-steep drop and threw the boy, he fell down.

25
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,360
Immediately he lay on the deer, he fell into water. The dog also did this.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,350
The boy heard something, peeped and had a look around a log.

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,030
He pushed at the log and saw a loving couple of frogs, sitting romantically next to each other and embracing.

28
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,450
The boy leaned foward and was dazzled to see baby frogs sitting in a line.

29
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,410
He took one of the baby frogs whose parents embraced, indicating they wanted to stay.

30
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,290
The baby frog's father let him go with the boy and he carried it as he walked home.
