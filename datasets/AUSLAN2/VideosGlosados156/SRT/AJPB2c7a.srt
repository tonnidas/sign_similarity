This story is about a boy who is sleeping...

1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:13,053
No, first he puts a frog into a big glass jar.

2
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,395
The dogs hops into the bed and they sleep.

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,508
When he wakes up the next morning, the frog is gone!

4
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:23,768
He looks around for the frog. He shakes out all his socks, but doesn't find the frog.

5
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:30,308
The dog wants to help look, but he sticks his head right in the glass jar, and gets stuck, the poor thing.

6
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:35,645
The boy is still looking around, when he sees the open window. He opens it and calls out for the frog.

7
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:38,103
But the dog falls out of the window, and manages to break the jar off of his head.

8
00:00:38,132 --> 00:00:40,525
Finally, as the jar hits the ground, the glass breaks.

9
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:46,175
So the boy keeps searching for the frog, high and low, calling out for the frog, but it's disappeared.

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,300
As he's looking, he gets an idea. There's a tree with a hole in its trunk nearby.

11
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,310
The boy climbs up to it and peers in. But an angry owl bursts out and scares him. He thought the frog might be there, but it isn't.

12
00:00:55,361 --> 00:01:01,611
And then he gets chased by bees. There he is running along, a whole cloud of bees behind him.

13
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:06,871
So he's going along, searching, and he comes across a big rock.

14
00:01:06,914 --> 00:01:12,374
The boy climbs up onto this rock, and then he looks down and realises that it's actually a deer, from the other side it's a deer, and the boy is sitting on it. The deer takes of running.

15
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:16,954
The deer runs, and then bucks the boy off its back, he can't do anything, and over a drop into a pond.

16
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:19,819
And the dog jumps into the water too.

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,329
And then they see a big log near the pond.

18
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:25,606
They think the frog must be in there, and sneak up quietly.

19
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,609
They peer around the log and see that the frog has a whole row of baby frogs!

20
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:31,079
INDECIPHERABLE

21
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:39,049
Well, in the log they found, in the water, were more just-born baby frogs.
